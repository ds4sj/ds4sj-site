This website contains resources related to the practice of data science for social justice (DS4SJ) in the mathematical community (broadly construed). It has both a narrow and a broad purpose. 

The narrow purpose is to accompany the paper "Data Science for Social Justice in the Mathematics Community," which is currently [a preprint on the arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09282). We therefore supply [supplementary notes](notes.qmd) on the paper

The broader purpose is to serve as a convenient launch point for those who wish to begin work in DS4SJ. To this end, we offer [further resources](resources.qmd) for those who wish to learn more about the topic, including papers, organizations, and opportunities. We enthusiastically welcome [contributions](contributing.qmd) to the resource list. 



This website is currently in draft form and many components are under construction.
