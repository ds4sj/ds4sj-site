We therefore supply supplementary notes on the paper\nThe broader purpose is to serve as a convenient launch point for those who wish to begin work in DS4SJ. To this end, we offer further resources for those who wish to learn more about the topic, including papers, organizations, and opportunities. We enthusiastically welcome contributions to the resource list.\nThis website is currently in draft form and many components are under construction."
